/**
 
@mainpage Introduction to libacvp
 
This document describes libacvp, a library that implements an ACVP client
based on https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP and a command line application
that provides configuration and invocation of the algorithm testing.



 
This document is organized as follows.  The first chapter provides 
background material on ACVP, an overview of libacvp and an overview
of the acvp_app.  The subsequent
chapters provide a detailed reference to the libacvp API and related
functions.  The reference material is created automatically (using the
doxygen utility) from comments embedded in some of the C header
files.

@section Features Supported Features

 
The user should be aware that it is possible to misuse this library,
which may result in inadequate security.  If you are implementing a 
feature using this library, you will want to read the Security Considerations 
section of the ACVP specs(https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP).  In addition, it is important that 
you read and understand the terms outlined in the @ref LICENSE section.


@section Installing Installing and Building libacvp 

@latexonly

To install libacvp, download the latest release of the distribution.  

libacvp uses the GNU \texttt{autoconf} and \texttt{make}
utilities\footnote{BSD make may not work; if both versions of make
are on your platform, you may have to invoke GNU make as \texttt{gmake}.}.  In
the \texttt{libest} directory, run the configure script and then make:
\begin{verbatim}
  ./configure [ options ]       
  make                          
  make install
\end{verbatim}

This package has been tested on both 32 and 64 bit Linux systems running
CentOS and Ubuntu.  The OpenSSL development package should be installed
on the system, or CiscoSSL can be used.

@section Examples Example Code

@latexonly

The example application is built automatically when building libacvp.


Note, the example code is not suitable for including into 
commercial software.  The example apps is primarily used to test
the libacvp library in linux and to show how the API should be used.  The
example code does not have all the appropriate error handling
and robust design required for commercial software.
